## About the Data

The dataset used in this project contains details of Uber rides taken by users. The key fields in the dataset include:

START_DATE: Date and time when the trip started (Object).

END_DATE: Date and time when the trip ended (Object).

CATEGORY: Type of trip (e.g., Business, Personal) (Object).

START: Starting point of the trip (Object).

STOP: Destination of the trip (Object).

MILES: Distance traveled during the trip (Float).

PURPOSE: Reason for the trip (e.g., Meeting, Airport) (Object).

## Why This Topic

This project focuses on Uber data analytics for several reasons:

User-Centric Approach: Analyzing Uber rides helps us understand user behavior and patterns in ridesharing.

Practical Approach: Ride data is real-world data with diverse applications in transportation and urban planning.

Ethical Consideration: Understanding the impact of ridesharing platforms on cities and communities is crucial for improving transportation solutions.

## Data Cleaning

The raw Uber dataset was not in a perfect state and required extensive data cleaning. The steps involved included:

Handling missing values and outliers.

Converting date and time data to appropriate formats.

Standardizing categorical fields.

Removing duplicates and irrelevant records.

Addressing inconsistencies in ride categories and trip purposes.
